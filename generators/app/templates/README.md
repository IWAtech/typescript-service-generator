## Development

Following scripts are available to you (in the package.json):

- `start` Starts the webserver (executes lib/index.js)
- `start:watch` Same as `start` but restarts when file changes are detected
- `build` Compliles the typescript sources to javascript
- `build:docker` Builds sources, packages them into a docker image and push it to the DockerHub repository
- `test` Runs all specs
- `test:coverage` Runs all specs and generates a coverage report
- `watch` Same as build but stays active and watches for file changes

You can run them using `yarn run [script]`
